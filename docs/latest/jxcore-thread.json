Later in the code, you can call <code>release()</code> to signal the main thread, that the task has completed.\n\n</p>\n<p>The <code>timeout</code> parameter specifies, how many milliseconds the task should be kept alive, before automatic release will happen.\nThis parameter is optional, and if you don’t provide it, task will be alive forever, or until <code>process.release()</code> will be called.\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = function (obj) {\n\n    setTimeout(function () {\n       console.log(&quot;I&#39;m here after 2000 ms.

On the other hand, every <code>process.release()</code> invocation - decrements it.\nSo when you want to end the application - you should call the <code>release()</code> method the same amount of times as you have called <code>keepAlive()</code>.\nWhen that counter is zero - the main process may exit now.\n\n</p>\n"
