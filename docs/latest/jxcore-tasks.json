See the simplest example:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = function () {\n    console.log(&quot;this is message from thread no&quot;, process.threadId);\n};\n\njxcore.tasks.addTask(method);</code></pre>\n<p>Another one:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = {};\nmethod.define = function () {\n    require(&quot;./hello&quot;);\n    console.log(&quot;http server started on thread&quot;, process.threadId);\n    process.keepAlive();\n};\n\njxcore.tasks.runOnce(method);</code></pre>\n<p>Note that this particular example does nothing but running hello.js file in multiple threads.

Otherwise it may wait until the other tasks will finish or some of the subthreads will become idle.\n\n</p>\n<p>The task is the function <code>method</code> with optional <code>param</code> as an argument.

The first one is the <code>obj</code> object which we are describing right now, while the second argument is the result from the task <code>method</code>.\n\n</p>\n<p>There are few principles regarding adding the tasks, that you should be aware of:\n\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You cannot specify, in which of the subthreads your task will run. The subthread will be chosen automatically. You can find out, which subthread is used for that task only from inside the task itself (see <code>threadId</code> property in Subthreads API).</li>\n<li>If for example on your system <code>getThreadCount()</code> returns 3, and you add 3 tasks one after another, there is no guarantee, that each of them will run in its own subthread, but still it is one of the possibilities. But things can go also in many other ways: all of the 3 tasks can run in the same subthread, or two of them in one subthread, and the third in another, etc.</li>\n<li>Do not assume the tasks will be executed in the order of which they were added.</li>\n<li>When the task <code>method</code> returns from its execution block (for example by calling return statement), it is considered as completed. This means, that if you use in the task code any delayed execution with <code>setTimeout()</code> or <code>setInterval()</code>, or async calls, the task method may return faster, before those delayed/async jobs will have chance to complete. For gaining control over task’s execution time, please use <code>process.keepAlive()</code> and <code>process.release()</code> methods from Subthreads API.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Adding a task with one-argument callback:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = function (param) {\n   console.log(&quot;We are in a subthread now.
